This is a text watermarking app for images.

The text can be dragged within the boundaries of the image.
You can change the font, font color, font size, text alignment, transparency, and angle of the text.

Give it some time (maybe 1 to 2 minutes) to get the correct coordinates before saving the image.

Checkout the watermarked images in the results folder.
